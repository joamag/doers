# Doers

Extra project associated with the goers project, the sole objective of the project is
to test the created [goers](https://github.com/joamag/goers) infra-structure.

## Execution

To execute the ``doers`` command line utility locally (under the current path) use the
following set of commands.

```bash
go get github.com/joamag/doers/src/doers
go build github.com/joamag/doers/src/doers
```

If the intent is to install the doers into the ``$GOPATH`` directory the global install
mode should be activated using:

```bash
go get -u github.com/joamag/doers/src/doers
```
